Basic project structure with build tasks for angular2 and electron projects

I am using Angular2 BETA version, which should now be stable to develop with. Note that some tutorials on the internet will
not work, as they might be written for the alfa version.

This boilerplate will be possibly changed a lot in the beginning, as I remove unnecessary things and problems.
Any help or advice will be appreciated

Also using:
* gulp
